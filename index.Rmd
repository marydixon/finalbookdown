# Introduction

SOCR580A7, Introduction to Environmental Data Science, covers R coding fundamentals in order to prepare graduate students to analyze environmental data. This bookdown document outlines the weekly topics and assignments of SOCR580A7.

## Structure 

Each chapter represents one week of course material. At the beginning of each chapter, there is code and material written by the professors, Drs. Matt Ross and Nathan Mueller. These materials are labelled "Instructor Created Content". 

After the content written by the course instructors, the assignment for the week follows.  

This course began with workflow tools using R markdown and Github. The course progressed to cover data visualizations, functions, spatial analyses, linear models, and machine learning. 

## Weekly Topics

 - **Intro/Overview:** Week 1, Jan 17-21.  Environmental data basics, data types, file management (*no assignment this week*)  
 - **Workflow Tools:** Week 2, Jan 24-28.  RMarkdown, Git, Github  
 - **Data Wrangling and Key Programming Concepts:** Week 3, Jan 31-Feb 4. Data munging, indexing, cleaning
